Orientation Rules

Use REP-103 names:

Roll = rotate about X

Pitch = rotate about Y

Yaw = rotate about Z

BUT apply them in the end-effector’s own coordinate frame, defined as:

+X = left

+Y = up

+Z = forward (tool pointing direction)

Because the tool points along +Z instead of REP-103’s usual +X, the meanings of the rotations shift:

Resulting Motion Meanings (with signs)
1. Turn left / right → Pitch (± about Y)

Rotation about the Y axis rotates the forward axis (+Z) toward left or right.

+pitch = turn left (rotate +Z toward +X)

–pitch = turn right (rotate +Z toward –X)

2. Tilt up / down → Roll (± about X)

Rotation about the X axis rotates the forward axis (+Z) toward up or down.

+roll = tilt down (rotate +Z toward –Y)

–roll = tilt up (rotate +Z toward +Y)

3. Twist clockwise / counter-clockwise → Yaw (± about Z)

Rotation about the Z axis spins around the tool’s own forward direction.

+yaw = twist clockwise (right-hand rule)

–yaw = twist counter-clockwise
