**Use REP-103 rotation names (roll = rotate about X, pitch = rotate about Y, yaw = rotate about Z).
However, apply these rotations in the end-effector’s own coordinate frame, where:

+X = left

+Y = up

+Z = forward.**

Because the end effector faces +Z instead of +X, the meanings change:

Turn left/right = rotate the forward axis (+Z) toward ±X → rotation about Y → pitch

Tilt up/down = rotate the forward axis (+Z) toward ±Y → rotation about X → roll

Twist around the tool’s forward axis = rotation about Z → yaw

Nothing about REP-103 is changed — only the frame they are applied in.
