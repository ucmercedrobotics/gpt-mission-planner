Polygon corners (approximate GPS coordinates):

Top Left (NW) (tree 1): 37.266444065315824, -120.42077086828617

Top Right (NE) (tree 8): 37.266442370268216, -120.4201085438839

Bottom Left (SW) (tree 137): 37.265775999999995, -120.4207689

Grid size:

8 trees per row

18 trees per columns

Total trees: 18 × 8 = 144 trees

RULES:

Numbering: ONE-BASED INDEXING NOT ZERO INDEX, ordered left-to-right, top-to-bottom (like reading a book) for all trees. i.e tree 1 is row 1, column 1.
Tasks should almost always require driving to a tree and then doing an action unless doing multiple actions at the same tree.

You cannot drive through columns of trees!
If you require to move between columns to sample a tree you must also include intermediate trees that get you out and in columns (first or last row).
