Grid size:

3 trees per row

4 trees per columns

Total trees: 4 × 3 = 12 trees

RULES:

Numbering: ONE-BASED INDEXING NOT ZERO INDEX, ordered left-to-right, top-to-bottom (like reading a book) for all trees. i.e tree 1 is row 1, column 1.
Tasks should almost always require driving to a tree and then doing an action unless doing multiple actions at the same tree.

You cannot drive through columns of trees!
If you require to move between columns to sample a tree you must also include intermediate trees that get you out and in columns (first or last row).
