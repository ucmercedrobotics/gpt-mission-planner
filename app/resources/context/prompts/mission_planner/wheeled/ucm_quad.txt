FARM LAYOUT:
Polygon corners (approximate GPS coordinates):

Top (N) (tree 1): 37.366449, -120.423065

Right (E) (tree 5): 37.366273, -120.422867

Left (W) (tree 46): 37.366288, -120.423292

Bottom (S) (tree 50): 37.366118, -120.423083

Grid size:

5 trees per row

10 trees per columns

Total trees: 5 × 10 = 50 trees

RULES:

Numbering: ONE-BASED INDEXING NOT ZERO INDEX, ordered left-to-right, top-to-bottom (like reading a book) for all trees. i.e tree 1 is row 1, column 1.
Tasks should almost always require driving to a tree and then doing an action unless doing multiple actions at the same tree.

You cannot drive through columns of trees!
If you require to move between columns to sample a tree you must also include intermediate trees that get you out and in columns (first or last row).
