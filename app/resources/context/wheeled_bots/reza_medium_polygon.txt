FARM LAYOUT:
Polygon corners (approximate GPS coordinates):

Top Left (NW) (tree 1): 37.26643908, -120.42079453

Top Right (NE): 37.26644777, -120.42012318

Bottom Left (SW): 37.26578751, -120.42079999

Bottom Right (SE) (tree 144): 37.26578860, -120.42011635

Grid size:

8 trees per row

18 trees per columns

Total trees: 18 × 8 = 144 trees

RULES:

Numbering: ONE-BASED INDEXING NOT ZERO INDEX, ordered left-to-right, top-to-bottom (like reading a book) for all trees. i.e tree 1 is row 1, column 1.
Tasks should almost always require driving to a tree and then doing an action unless doing multiple actions at the same tree.

You cannot drive through columns of trees!
If you require to move between columns to sample a tree you must also include intermediate trees that get you out and in columns (first or last row).
