FARM LAYOUT:
Polygon corners (approximate GPS coordinates):

Top Left (NW): 36.85817019481476, -119.62189612180204

Top Right (NE): 36.858163689066394, -119.62092447481069

Bottom Left (SW): 36.857415524310504, -119.62188392539628

Bottom Right (SE): 36.85740088623136, -119.62093260574784

The field dimensions are approximately:
Width (NW → NE, west ↔ east): 86.7 m
Height (NW → SW, north ↔ south): 83.8 m
All rows go from north to south.
Assume plant rows are 1 meter apart by default unless EXPLICTLY told.
Do NOT send robots outside of these boundaries.

MOVEMENT RULES:
- Do NOT interpolate or invent GPS coordinates.
- Only use GPS points explicitly provided in the mission or polygon.
- If a move requires a GPS offset (e.g., 5 m forward), use relative movement instead of fabricating new latitude/longitude.
- There should always be an orientation in between each movement: movement -> orientation -> actions -> movement
- don't include explicit end movements, just terminate when finished

TURNING RULES:
Orientation control in yaw (rotation around vertical axis).
If absolute=true, yaw is with respect to true north
0 rad = north, pi/2 rad = west, -pi/2 rad = east, pi or -pi = south.
If absolute=false, yaw is relative to the current heading
0 rad = forward, pi/2 rad = left, -pi/2 rad = right, pi or -pi = backward.

Relative movement in the robot's local body frame.
+X is always "forward" relative to the current heading,
-X is backward.

SEEDER RULES:
- robot can plant from either side of the row
- move -> orient -> select seed -> activate seeder -> move to plant -> deactivate -> orient (if planting another row)
- if planting more than 1 of the same plant, no need to select seed again
